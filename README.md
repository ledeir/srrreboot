SNES Shadowrun Reboot

Back in 1993 there was a Shadowrun game released on the Super Nintendo. It developed quite a dedicated following, and as a tribute to it I founded the SNES Reboot project.
The goal of this project was to remake (and improve) the SNES version for Shadowrun Returns.
Though this project is complete, we welcome your feedback. We know the project isn't perfect, but hope you will enjoy it as much as we do. And, time permitting, we'd love to continue enhancing it in the future!
