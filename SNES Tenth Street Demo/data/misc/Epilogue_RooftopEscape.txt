As the AI unleashes its death cry, the building starts to shake as the lab's self destruct protocal activates.

You flee towards the roof, calling anyone, and everyone, who may be able to help. 

Fortunately you made the right friends and a VTOL is on its way. 

Not only do you save the world, but you manage to save your skin as well. 

As you fly off into the sunset, you could swear you hear the voice of Dog on the wind...

"You have done well, young one. Your destiny is now in your hands!
			Live long whelp, live long."

Though this adventure is over, we'll meet again in Shadowrun II!
