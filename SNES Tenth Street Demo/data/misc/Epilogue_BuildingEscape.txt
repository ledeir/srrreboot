Anything worth doing, is worth overdoing. 

Not content to save the world from a rogue AI, you want to save everyone you can.

Ignoring the VTOL waiting on the roof, you rush down the shaking stairs to evacuate any surviving staff as well.

You search until the last possible second and finally run out the door as the building collapses behind you...

As you collapse from exhaustion, you can hear the voice of Dog in your mind 
	"You have done well, young one. Your destiny is now in your hands!
			Live long whelp, live long."

Though this adventure is over, we'll meet again in Shadowrun II!
